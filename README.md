# Project---Insurance-Data-Analysis-with-Python
This project has been an incredible learning experience, reinforcing my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and predictive analytics. Excited to apply these insights to real-world problems
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Cleaned and visualized key trends in insurance charges, identifying correlations between age, BMI, smoking status, and other factors.
ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization â€“ Created compelling plots to showcase trends, such as age vs. charges by smoking status, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
